## ðŸ“Œ Discussion  

### **Practical Implications for Practitioners**  

- **Improving Risk Communication:**  
  Our findings suggest that current phishing risk messages often **[Describe Bias or Issues in Messaging]**.  
  - Practitioners should focus on **[Key Recommendation, e.g., avoiding fear-based messaging, increasing empowerment narratives]**.  
  - Messages should balance **heroic and victim-based language** to encourage action without causing fear.  

- **Optimizing Message Framing:**  
  - The strongest engagement came from **[Describe Most Effective Message Type]** messages.  
  - **Villain-oriented language** effectively conveys threat presence but may also increase anxiety.  

### **Threats to Validity**  

- **Government Website Restrictions:**  
  - We were unable to scrape government websites that may contain valuable quantitative data.  
  - Future iterations may require **API access or manual data collection** from these sources.  

- **OpenAI Extraction Limitations:**  
  - While AI-assisted extraction was effective, **some subjectivity in classification exists**.  
  - Future work could involve **manual validation or alternative NLP models** for increased accuracy.

### **ðŸ“Œ Next Steps**  

- **Refining NLP Extraction:** Improve hero/victim/villain classification accuracy.  
- **Extending Data Sources:** Seek alternative sources for quantitative risk messaging data.  
- **A/B Testing Messages:** Evaluate real-world effectiveness with target audiences.
