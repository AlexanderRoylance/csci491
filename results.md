**Pipeline Levels:**  

1. **Scraping Level** → Extracts website text  
2. **Preprocessing Level** → Cleans and standardizes text  
3. **Operationalization Level** → Extracts Hero/Victim/Villain language  
4. **NLP Level** → Computes TF-IDF and sentiment analysis  
5. **Message Generation Level** → Constructs risk communication message segments  
6. **Analysis Level** → Visualizes and contextualizes findings

##  Results  

Our analysis produced the following key findings:  

1. **TF-IDF Analysis:**  
   - The most frequently occurring words in risk communication messages were **[Insert Key Words]**.  
   - Bigram analysis highlighted phrases like **[Insert Key Bigrams]**, reinforcing messaging patterns.  

2. **Sentiment Analysis:**  
   - Overall sentiment skewed **[Negativec]**, with villain-related words carrying the strongest sentiment weight.  
   - Hero language showed **[Insert Sentiment Findings]**, while victim language was **[Insert Sentiment Findings]**.

##  Discussion  

### **Practical Implications for Practitioners**  

- **Improving Risk Communication:**  
  Our findings suggest that current phishing risk messages often lack low reading level languages and are overly complex.  
  - Practitioners should focus on **[Key Recommendation, e.g., avoiding fear-based messaging, increasing empowerment narratives]**.  
  - Messages should balance **heroic and victim-based language** to encourage action without causing fear.  

- **Optimizing Message Framing:**  
  - The strongest engagement came from **[Describe Most Effective Message Type]** messages.  
  - **Villain-oriented language** effectively conveys threat presence but may also increase anxiety.  

### **Threats to Validity**  

- **Government Website Restrictions:**  
  - We were unable to scrape government websites that may contain valuable quantitative data.  
  - Future iterations may require **API access or manual data collection** from these sources.  

- **OpenAI Extraction Limitations:**  
  - While AI-assisted extraction was effective, **some subjectivity in classification exists**.  
  - Future work could involve **manual validation or alternative NLP models** for increased accuracy.

### ** Next Steps**  

- **Refining NLP Extraction:** Improve hero/victim/villain classification accuracy.  
- **Extending Data Sources:** Seek alternative sources for quantitative risk messaging data.  
- **A/B Testing Messages:** Evaluate real-world effectiveness with target audiences.
